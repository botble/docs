# Source Code Structure

## Introduction

Botble CMS provides full source code with no encryption. The codebase is structured using a modular architecture, which makes it highly extensible and maintainable.

## Modular Architecture

Botble CMS follows a modular architecture pattern in Laravel, which separates the application into distinct modules, each responsible for a specific feature or functionality.

## Source Code Location

The main source code is located in the `/platform` directory. This directory contains all the core modules, plugins, and themes that make up the CMS.

## Directory Structure

The platform directory is organized into several key directories:

- **core**: Contains the core modules of the CMS
- **packages**: Contains reusable packages that can be used across different projects
- **plugins**: Contains feature-specific plugins that extend the CMS functionality
- **themes**: Contains the frontend themes for the CMS

## Module Structure Example

Let's take the Blog plugin as an example to understand the structure of a module:

- **Controllers**: `platform/plugins/blog/src/Http/Controllers`
- **Views**: `platform/plugins/blog/resources/views`
- **Routes**: `platform/plugins/blog/routes/web.php`
- **Migrations**: `platform/plugins/blog/database/migrations`

Each module follows a similar structure, making it easy to understand and navigate the codebase.

## Frontend Themes

Frontend themes are located in the `platform/themes` directory. Each theme is a separate directory containing all the necessary files for the theme, including views, assets, and configuration files.

## Extending Botble CMS

The modular architecture of Botble CMS makes it easy to extend its functionality by creating new plugins and themes. There are many free plugins available on the [Botble Marketplace](https://marketplace.botble.com/products) which are developed by the community, and they can be installed directly from the admin panel by navigating to Plugins â†’ Add new plugin.

This approach to structuring the codebase allows for:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles a specific feature or functionality
2. **Reusability**: Modules can be reused across different projects
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to one module don't affect others
4. **Scalability**: New features can be added as new modules without modifying existing code
5. **Testability**: Modules can be tested in isolation
