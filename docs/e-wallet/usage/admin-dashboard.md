## What You'll See

### Key Numbers

The dashboard shows these important numbers at the top:

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Total Wallets** | How many customers have wallets |
| **Active Wallets** | Wallets that have money in them |
| **Total Balance** | All the money stored in all wallets combined |
| **Total Credits** | All money ever added to wallets (top-ups, refunds, etc.) |
| **Total Debits** | All money ever taken from wallets (purchases, withdrawals) |
| **Transactions Today** | Number of wallet transactions in the last 24 hours |

### Charts and Reports

Below the numbers, you'll find:

- **Transaction Trends** - A chart showing wallet activity over time
- **Top Wallets** - Customers with the highest balances
- **Recent Transactions** - The latest wallet activity

## Understanding the Numbers

### Total Balance

This is the total amount of money sitting in all customer wallets. This money:
- Belongs to your customers
- Can be used for purchases
- Can be withdrawn by customers

::: tip Good to Know
A high total balance means customers trust your wallet system and prefer keeping money with you!

### Active vs Total Wallets

- **Total Wallets** = Everyone who has ever had a wallet
- **Active Wallets** = Only customers with money in their wallet right now

If you have 100 total wallets but only 20 active, it means 80 customers have empty wallets.

### Credits vs Debits

- **Credits** = Money going INTO wallets (good for customers)
- **Debits** = Money going OUT of wallets (purchases or withdrawals)
