## Adjusting a Customer's Balance

Sometimes you need to add or remove money from a customer's wallet manually. Here's how:

### When to Adjust Balance

Common reasons:
- **Giving a refund** that wasn't automatic
- **Promotional credit** (birthday bonus, loyalty reward)
- **Compensation** for a problem or complaint
- **Fixing a mistake** in a previous transaction
- **Special discount** for a VIP customer

### How to Add Money (Credit)

1. Go to **E-Wallet** → **Wallets**
2. Find the customer's wallet
3. Click **Adjust Balance**
4. Choose **Credit** (to add money)
5. Enter the amount (e.g., 50 for $50)
6. Write a note explaining why (e.g., "Birthday bonus")
7. Click **Save**

The customer will immediately see the new balance.

### How to Remove Money (Debit)

1. Go to **E-Wallet** → **Wallets**
2. Find the customer's wallet
3. Click **Adjust Balance**
4. Choose **Debit** (to remove money)
5. Enter the amount to remove
6. Write a note explaining why
7. Click **Save**

::: warning Be Careful
You cannot remove more money than the customer has (unless negative balance is enabled in settings).

## Understanding Wallet Balances

### How Balance Works

- Balance is shown in your store's currency
- Customers can only spend what they have
- Balance updates instantly after any transaction

### Zero Balance

A wallet with $0 balance is normal. It means:
- Customer spent all their money, OR
- Customer never added money yet

The wallet still exists and is ready to use.

## Automatic Wallet Creation

You don't need to create wallets manually. Wallets are created automatically when:

- A new customer signs up
- A customer adds money for the first time
- You adjust a balance for a customer who doesn't have a wallet yet

## Best Practices

### Keep Good Records

Always write clear notes when adjusting balances:

| Good Note | Bad Note |
|-----------|----------|
| "Compensation for late delivery on Order #1234" | "Credit" |
| "Birthday bonus - 10% of last month's purchases" | "Bonus" |
| "Refund for returned item - blue shirt" | "Refund" |

### Regular Reviews

- Check wallets with high balances monthly
- Look for inactive wallets (no transactions in 6+ months)
- Monitor for unusual activity

### Customer Communication

When you adjust a balance:
- Consider sending an email to the customer
- Explain what changed and why
- Provide a reference number if applicable

## Common Questions

### Can I delete a wallet?

No, wallets cannot be deleted. This protects the transaction history. If a wallet has $0 balance, it simply stays inactive.

### What if I made a mistake?

If you added or removed the wrong amount:
1. Make another adjustment to correct it
2. Write a note explaining the correction
3. Both adjustments will show in the history

### Can customers have multiple wallets?

No, each customer has exactly one wallet tied to their account.
