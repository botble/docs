## üß™ Step 5: Test Your Setup

After adding both configuration files:

1. **Build and run your app:**
   - Connect a real device (not simulator)
   - Run the app

2. **Test notifications:**
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Navigate to **"Cloud Messaging"**
   - Click **"Send your first message"**
   - Enter a test message and send

3. **Check if it works:**
   - You should receive the notification on your device
   - If not, check the Troubleshooting section below

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Nothing happens when I send a test notification
- Make sure you're using a real device (not simulator/emulator)
- Check that you copied the files to the correct folders
- For iOS: Ensure you enabled Push Notifications in Xcode
- Try restarting the app

### Where do I find my package name/bundle ID?
- **Android package name:** Look in `android/app/build.gradle` for `applicationId`
- **iOS bundle ID:** Look in Xcode under your target's General tab

### I don't have an Apple Developer account
- You need one for iOS push notifications in production ($99/year)
- For testing only, you might be able to use development certificates
