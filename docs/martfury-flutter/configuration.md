# Configuration Guide

How to connect your app to your website and customize basic settings.

## 🔗 Connect to Your Website

### Step 1: Find Your Website URL
Your website URL is the address people use to visit your online store.
Examples:
- `https://mystore.com`
- `https://shop.mycompany.com`
- `https://mystore.botble.com`

### Step 2: Update App Configuration
1. Open the `.env` file in your app folder
2. Find this line:
   ```
   API_BASE_URL=https://ecommerce-api.botble.com
   ```
3. Replace it with your website:
   ```
   API_BASE_URL=https://your-website.com
   ```
4. Save the file

### Step 3: Test the Connection
1. Run your app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
2. Try to login with an account from your website
3. If it works, you're connected! 🎉
