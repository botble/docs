# How to Use Wholesale

Welcome to the Wholesale user guide! This section will help you understand how to use the B2B pricing and customer management system in your online store.

## What is Wholesale?

Wholesale is a B2B system that allows store owners to offer different prices to different types of customers based on their customer group, order quantities, and business relationships. Think of it as a way to reward bulk buyers and business customers with better pricing.

Customers can:

- **Apply for wholesale accounts** with business information
- **Receive special pricing** based on their customer group
- **See quantity-based discounts** with tiered pricing
- **Purchase products at volume** with enforced MOQs
- **Access exclusive products** restricted to wholesale customers

## Pricing Structure Example

You can create sophisticated pricing structures:

### Customer Groups

| Group | Discount | Min Order Qty | Min Order Value |
|-------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Platinum | 25% | 200 | $2,000 |
| Gold | 20% | 100 | $1,000 |
| Silver | 15% | 50 | $500 |
| Bronze | 10% | 25 | $250 |

### Tiered Pricing (Example Product: $100 retail)

**For Gold Members:**

| Quantity | Price | Total for Tier |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| 1-49 | $80 (20% off) | - |
| 50-99 | $75 (25% off) | $3,750+ |
| 100-249 | $70 (30% off) | $7,000+ |
| 250+ | $65 (35% off) | $16,250+ |

Customer ordering 150 units pays $70 each = $10,500 total (saves $4,500!)
