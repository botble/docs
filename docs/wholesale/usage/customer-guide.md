## Common Questions

### Can I buy just one unit?

Some products have minimum order quantities. Check each product's MOQ requirement. Many products allow single-unit purchases for wholesale customers.

### Why don't I see the pricing table?

Pricing tables only appear on products that have volume discounts. If you only see your group discount, that product doesn't have additional tiered pricing.

### Can I place orders for multiple locations?

Yes! You can add multiple shipping addresses in your account and ship different items to different locations in a single order.

### What if I need to return something?

Return policies vary by store. Check the store's return policy or contact customer service. Wholesale orders may have different return terms than retail.

### How often can I reorder?

As often as you like! There's typically no limit on order frequency, only minimum order amounts per order.

### Can I get better pricing?

Contact your account manager to discuss:
- Volume commitments
- Annual contracts
- Exclusive products
- Custom pricing tiers
