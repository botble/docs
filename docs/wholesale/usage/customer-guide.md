### What changes when you're a wholesale customer

**Pricing table** - Some products show a table with quantity-based discounts:

For example:

| Quantity | Price per unit | You save |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| 1-49 | $80 | 20% |
| 50-99 | $75 | 25% |
| 100+ | $70 | 30% |

**Wholesale-only products** - You may see products that retail customers can't see. These are exclusive to wholesale accounts.

**Minimum quantities** - Some products require a minimum order quantity. If you try to add fewer than the minimum, the quantity will be adjusted automatically.

### Checking your wholesale status

1. Log in to your account
2. Go to your customer dashboard
3. Look for the **Wholesale Account** section at `/customer/wholesale/`

This page shows:
- Your application status (Pending, Approved, or Rejected)
- Your assigned customer group and discount level
- Your company details

### Updating your company information

1. Go to `/customer/wholesale/profile/edit` (or find it in your dashboard)
2. Update your company details
3. Click **Save**

## Shopping as a Wholesale Customer

### Adding products to cart

1. Browse products as usual
2. If a product has a minimum order quantity, you must meet it
3. If a product has quantity increments (e.g., multiples of 12), the quantity will snap to the nearest valid amount
4. Add to cart - your wholesale price is applied automatically

### Viewing your savings

In the cart, you'll see wholesale prices applied to each item. Some stores show the savings amount next to each item.

### Checking out

Checkout works the same as a regular purchase. Your wholesale prices are locked in at checkout.

### Meeting order minimums

Your customer group may have minimum order requirements:

- **Minimum order quantity** - Total items in cart must meet this number
- **Minimum order value** - Cart subtotal must meet this amount

If you don't meet the minimums, you'll see a message at checkout explaining what's needed.

## Reapplying After Rejection

If your application was rejected:

1. Go to `/customer/wholesale/reapply` (or find it in your wholesale dashboard)
2. The rejection reason is shown so you know what to address
3. Fill out the reapplication form with updated information
4. Submit
