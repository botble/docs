### Shipping Settings

- **Auto Add Shipping**: When enabled, shipping costs will be automatically added to orders based on the default shipping amount.
- **Default Shipping Amount**: Set the default shipping amount for POS orders. This amount will be used when auto-add shipping is enabled or when manually adding shipping.
